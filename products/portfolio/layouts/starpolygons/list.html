<h1>Star polygons</h1>
<p>A star polygon is a geometrical figure formed by connecting equally spaced points on a circumference (p) with straight lines skipping every q-1 points. 
    A common notation for star polygons is called Schl√§ffi notation and it looks like {p/q}. 
    It is assumed that p and q are coprime, meaning the only common divisor they have is 1. 
    Yet it is possible to construct a star with p and q not being coprime numbers, the star polygon like this would be then called degenerate star polygon.
To construct a degenerate star polygon start with any point and with each q-th point. 
When the initial point is reached, choose the next unconnected point and repeat the procedure.
The degenerate star polygon consists of q unconnected p/q polygons.
A curious property of star polygons: a star polygon of {p/q} looks exactly like a star polygon {p/p-q}.
Try playing with constructing different star polygons with the interactive plot below!
Regular star polygons are plotted in black color and degenerate star polygons are plotted with blue color.</p>
